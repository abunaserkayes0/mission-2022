          <h3>Mission</h3>
          <p>
            In order to get the most value from this exercise I suggest you
            combine the two into a vision and mission statement. Define the
            overall essence of what you want to achieve and then look at what
            you are doing to achieve it.

          <h3>Vision</h3>
          <p>
            My vision is a world where everyone is contributing with their full
            potential; where each person uses their intrinsic genius and
            leadership to deliver outstanding value-added projects

          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p>
            In life, you're going to have to speak up for yourself from time to
            time. We don't always have someone there to defned ourselves.
            Speaking up also makes you more visible to people, some of whom who
            could give you a great opportunity.
