            In order to get the most value from this exercise I suggest you
            combine the two into a vision and mission statement. Define the
            overall essence of what you want to achieve and then look at what
            you are doing to achieve it.

            leadership value-added projects. Consider the people, tasks, and
            emotions that accompany a particular vision or goal.

          <p>
            In life, you're going to have to speak up for yourself from time to
            time. We don't always have someone there to defined ourselves.
            Speaking up also makes you more visible to people, some of whom who
            could give you a great opportunity.

          Development is a process by which a musical idea is communicated in
          the course of a composition. It refers to the transformation and
          restatement of initial material. Development is often contrasted with
          musical variation, which is a slightly different means to the same
          end.
